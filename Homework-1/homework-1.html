            <h3> Education</h3>
            <p>I'm a current freshman planning to study Biostatistics and Public Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
                As an ardent mental health advocate, I'm specifically driven to learn about how computer science and data science can be used to 
                develop <strong>culturally-informed and data-driven</strong> healthcare policy.</p> 
            <p>As a member of the education team at CS+SG, I'm interested in learning more about web development and using these skills to 
                take part in projects aimed at advancing social well-being in my community.</p>
